# tagsplorer
A quick and resource-efficient OS-independent tagging filetree extension tool and library written in Python, working with both Python versions 2 and 3.

## Problem statement
Nowadays most operating systems and window managers still adhere to the "tree of files" metaphor, or try to employ some kind of integrated search engine to find and access existing files.
Both approaches have strong drawbacks that could be solved by tagging files individually, and only when needed.

### Problems with file trees
Each file belongs to only one parent folder, which practically prohibits a file to be found under more than one category. This can be solved locally by using soft or hard links, if the OS supports them, or storing the same file several times in different folders. In that case, however, you either loose OS-independence, compatibility with version control systems becomes clunky and error-prone, or you have lots of duplication that again leads to human errors.

### Problems with search engines
There are (semantic) intelligent search engines that continuously crawl and oversee your file system, guessing and suggesting what you might want to access next. Here the problem lies in the system overhead and loss of control - you don't know if you are presented the right file versions, and if you search for the right terms.

## Solution: tagsplorer to the rescue!
Tagsplorer uses a simple concept which enables you to continue using simple and compatible file trees, keep all your data under version control of your choice, allows you to put files or entire folders into more than one (virtual) category, and still benefit from little manual maintenance or additional setup.
